#Parking sytem
This project presents a parking lot system developed in Java, incorporating basic dummy database functionality. The system is designed to showcase various software design principles, patterns, and industry standards. It provides a practical example of how to implement object-oriented programming techniques to create a maintainable and scalable application. The project serves as a hands-on educational tool for understanding the intricacies of software design and architecture in a real-world context.

#Overview
This parking lot system is designed to handle multiple parking lots, each with its own floors and parking spaces. It’s set up so that each space can accommodate various types and sizes of vehicles, making sure there’s a spot that fits everything from small cars to larger trucks.
