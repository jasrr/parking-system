#Parking sytem
This project presents a parking lot system developed in Java, incorporating basic dummy database functionality. The system is designed to showcase various software design principles, patterns, and industry standards. It provides a practical example of how to implement object-oriented programming techniques to create a maintainable and scalable application. The project serves as a hands-on educational tool for understanding the intricacies of software design and architecture in a real-world context.

#Overview
This parking lot system helps manage several parking lots, each with multiple floors and parking spots. Every spot is tailored to fit different types of vehicles, so whether it’s a compact car or a larger truck, there’s a space that suits its size and type.
